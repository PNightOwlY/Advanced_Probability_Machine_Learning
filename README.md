# Introduction

In this project, we implement 3 methods(**PCA, PPCA, VAE**) to do dimention reduction. Variation AutoEncoder owns best performance of reconstruction of images, as well as in generating images. 

In the experiments, we encode the high dimension images to 2 dimension, and then decode, to see the differences between them which can also be called loss function. 

Then we read a paper which attached in **paper** folder, a method called **Robust Deep AutoEncoder**(RDAE), that can be used in dimension reduction and anomaly dection.
